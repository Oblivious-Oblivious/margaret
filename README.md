# Margaret

[![GPLv3 License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-GPL%20v3-yellow.svg)](./COPYING)

Margaret is a modern programming language focused around objects and messages.
It offers powerful literals, easy to use objects and smalltalk-like message structures.

* Every value in Margaret is treated as an object.
* There are no reserved words and no explicit syntax apart from message sends.
* Uses prototype based objects in the likes of Self or Javascript.
* Uses C-like literals like char, int, float, string.
* Implements tensors and hashes as the only built in, array-like data structures.
* Runs on a portable, lightweight and embeddable stack based VM.
