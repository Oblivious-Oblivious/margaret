## (âœ—) ver. 1.0.0
-----------------
  ðŸŸ¥ Implement all literals and stdlib
    ðŸŸ© $nil                                                  -> ($NilProto clone)   -> singleton
    ðŸŸ© $true                                                 -> ($TrueProto clone)  -> singleton
    ðŸŸ© $false                                                -> ($FalseProto clone) -> singleton
    ðŸŸ© 42, 4_200, 0b0110, 0B10, 0xbeef, 0X0427, 0o741, 0O210 -> ($IntegerProto clone)
    ðŸŸ© 42.0, 42_42.42_42                                     -> ($FloatProto clone)
    ðŸŸ© :some_symbol                                          -> ($SymbolProto clone)
    ðŸŸ© ::label                                               -> ($LabelProto clone)
    ðŸŸ© "foo\tbar"                                            -> ($StringProto clone)
    ðŸŸ© [42, "Hello", false]                                  -> ($TensorProto clone)
    ðŸŸ© %[1, 2]                                               -> ($TupleProto clone)
    ðŸŸ© %{"a": 1, b: 2}                                       -> ($TableProto clone)
    ðŸŸ© %(1::1, 0::1)                                         -> ($BitstringProto clone)
    ðŸŸ© {a | a + 1}                                           -> ($MethodProto clone) -> headless
    ðŸŸ© #put: element at: position => ()                      -> ($MethodProto clone) -> object bound
  ðŸŸ¥ Add an IDE that live inspects all values next to the code similar to Quokka.js
  ðŸŸ¥ Add visual literals of trees, graphs and matrices (2-dimentional data representation).
     Most likely part of an IDE that casts the data into tensors.

## (âœ—) ver. 0.0.4
-----------------
  ðŸŸ¥ FT-33 - Add syntax for using user defined inferred objects -> Inferred start_using: MyObject, one: 1 two: 2   -> (MyObject one: 1 two: 2) Inferred stop_using: MyObject

## (âœ—) ver. 0.0.3
-----------------
  ðŸŸ¥ FT-31 - Add green threads.
     Possibly MyObject can inherit from Margaret to not lose predefined marg messages
     FormalMessages step can always infer `Margaret` because at runtime it can replace the correct object using the inheritance structures.
     `one:two:` can be sent to MyObject, but `if:then:` can be sent to Margaret.
     `Margaret` uses delegation pattern: maintains a priority queue of objects with priority based on inheritance, first sends message to all children and to itself at last.
     e.g. for `MyObject2 < MyObject1 < Margaret`, we send `one:two:` to MyObject2, it fowards it to parents and finally to Margaret, which responds or sends `method_missing`.
  ðŸŸ¥ FT-32 - Add cascaded messages.

  ðŸŸ¥ QOL-06 - Decrease the size of the Instruction to 32 bits to imporove performance.
              Most likely 6 bits for opcode, and 13 bits for OAB commands that are PRIM and SEND.
              OA commands use 1<<25 bits for the A operand.
              OAB commands use 1<<13 for A and B and maybe draw from different pools.
              Maybe handle spilling by splitting methods into smaller ones.
  ðŸŸ¥ QOL-07 - Upgrade to a mark & sweep generational gc, gen0, gen1, gen2.
              Upgrade to a tricolor generational mark & sweep gc.
              Employ a separate process/thread for collection.
              Stress test for fragmentation issues.
              Store a fiber in each object that listens for collections.
              This fiber can choose to give itself for collection or not depending on whether the objects is being used for performance oriented calculation.
  ðŸŸ¥ QOL-08 - Modify the pipeline for cocurrent execution (tokenization -> parsing -> evaluation) token by token.
  ðŸŸ¥ QOL-09 - Optimize repeating bytecodes that offer no state change outside the loop.

## (âœ—) ver. 0.0.2
-----------------
  ðŸŸ¥ FT-05 - Separate value representation for small strings that store the characters inline in the value.
  ðŸŸ¥ FT-06 - In the NaN boxing scheme do not reallocate integer and float representations, instead use unboxed values directly.
  ðŸŸ¥ FT-13 - Add __LINE__ __FILE__ and __DIR__ macros.
  ðŸŸ¥ FT-18 - Add pattern matching and LISP style handling of items
             %[:car, :cdr] = %[1, 2, 3] # car = 1, cdr = %[2, 3]
             %[:car, :cdr] = %[1, 2] # car = 1, cdr = %[2], (flatten), cdr = 2
             %[:car, :cdr] = %[1] # car = 1, cdr = %[], (flatten), cdr = nil
             %[:car, :cdr] = %[] # car = nil, cdr = nil
  ðŸŸ¥ FT-20 - Add multimethod in a first-come-first-serve precedence
             Numeric bind: # 0 fact => 1
             Numeric bind: # _ fact => self * (self - 1) fact
             Numeric bind: # 0 ** a_number => 0
             Numeric bind: # 0 ** 0 => nil
             Array bind: # [] add: element at: position => 17
             Array bind: # [] add: 'a' at 0 => ['a']
             Array bind: # _ add: 'a' at 0 => ['a'] ++ self
             0 ** 0 => $nil,
             0 ** _ => 0,
             _ ** 0 => 1,
             ** _ => $true,
             x = 0,
             x ** 0,
             dispatch_multimethod(**, v1, v2) {
               if(NUMERIC_EQUALS(v1, 0) && NUMERIC_EQUALS(v2, 0)) {
                 $nil;
               } else if(NUMERIC_EQUALS(v1, 0)) {
                 0;
               } else if(NUMERIC_EQUALS(v2, 0)) {
                 1;
               } else {
                 $true;
               }
             }
  ðŸŸ¥ FT-22 - Pattern-match multimethods by hashing receiver and arguments.
             Every multi-method is hashed into a unique value and searched for in the method table of the receiver.
  ðŸŸ¥ FT-23 - Implement storing and loading bytecode from compiled files, similar to Java.
             Pipeline: compile constants to direct data -> load and store constants in VM -> execute by loading constants from table.
  ðŸŸ¥ FT-24 - Add big integers and big floats.
  ðŸŸ¥ FT-25 - Think of most syntax, semantic or runtime errors and spec them. 
  ðŸŸ¥ FT-26 - Add regular expressions.
  ðŸŸ¥ FT-27 - Create an object `detatch` functionality that removes the inheritance link and object model metadata.
             Add object `freezing` that removes state modification capabilities.
  ðŸŸ¥ FT-28 - Separate value types from object types.
             Add atomic types that become atemporal (cannot be extended through prototypes).
  ðŸŸ¥ FT-29 - Add a switch matcher -> `obj match: %[%[1, 100], %[2, 200], %[3, 300],]`.
  ðŸŸ¥ FT-30 - Create compile-time messages, which will make calculations in the emitter phase but will not generate bytecode.
  ðŸŸ¥ FT-34 - Keep formal bytecode as an easy to use intermediate for translating to other language VMs.
  ðŸŸ¥ FT-35 - Create an instruction inspector
  ðŸŸ¥ FT-36 - Add liveness analysis for reusing registers.
  ðŸŸ¥ FT-37 - Store line and char numbers on bytecode instructions.

  ðŸŸ¥ QOL-05 - Potentially use any type of local/instance/global variable as labels.  Requires that variables store their ip memory location.

  ðŸŸ© Add UTF8 and Unicode support.
  ðŸŸ© Optimize the design Table to be data-oriented (separate keys from values for locality).
  ðŸŸ© Optimize hash function for better string interning.

## (âœ—) ver. 0.0.1
-----------------
  ðŸŸ¥ BUG-01 - Fix headless method bytecode definitions and add tests.
  ðŸŸ¥ BUG-02 - Double check that vm works on 16-bit word machines with 32-bit pointers/doubles.
  ðŸŸ¥ BUG-03 - Disallow rebinding/reassigning the assignment message (=).

  ðŸŸ© FT-01 - Proposal for cc0-v1 license.
  ðŸŸ¥ FT-02 - Add lexically removed comments.
  ðŸŸ¥ FT-03 - Add string interpolation and formatting with `#{..}` or similar.
  ðŸŸ¥ FT-04 - Make comments part of the language (comment: "...", todo: "...").
             Make comments dynamic and persistent on code files.
             Since comments are dynamic, we can use interpolation to change them according to data (for documentation comments).
  ðŸŸ¥ FT-07 - Add a `@this`, `@it` or equivalent that refers to the original object.
             @this would always refer to object where original method is defined,
             not the object where the method is called.
  ðŸŸ¥ FT-08 - Define an opcode for calling native C functions and extensions.
             OABC command where:
               O is the opcode.
               A is the function name.
               B is the output register.
               C is the input tensor of arguments.
             Native C extensions require rebuilding of the language
             Use a ./margaret rebuild command of some sort that rebuilds with user-defined extensions and replaces itself.
  ðŸŸ¥ FT-09 - Manually add a `fillable` type instance for dead code bindings.
  ðŸŸ¥ FT-10 - Add functionality for reading multiple files and changing the VM pointer to the currect file we are scanning.
  ðŸŸ¥ FT-11 - Implement `while:` using the `goto:` primitive to avoid endless recursion.
  ðŸŸ¥ FT-12 - Add a `bind:` or `--` message to tensors so we can add tensors of unbound methods.
             $Margaret bind: [m1, m2, m3] binds those methods into $Object.
  ðŸŸ¥ FT-14 - Add a primitive for raising errors.  The raise: message is the only one that crashes the VM.
             $Numeric -- #/ 0 => raise: "division by zero",
             $Numeric -- #/ other => @self / other,
             If the analyzer cannot figure out the inputs of the division message, LSP warns for potential runtime crash.
  ðŸŸ© FT-15 - Use GOTO for break and continue. -> `list iterate: { elem | if: { elem == 42 } then: { goto: "exit_label" } elem puts }, ::exit_label`.
  ðŸŸ¥ FT-16 - Add complex numbers `(0+2i)`, and rational numbers `(1/2r)` -> unary messages.
             Add complex and rational specific messages.
  ðŸŸ¥ FT-17 - Add an internal include guard for the require primitive.
             LSP can track inlucded files and warn about redefinitions.
  ðŸŸ¥ FT-19 - table = {a: 1, b: 2}, table = table ++ {c: 3}. #{a: 1, b: 2, c: 3}
             l = [1,2,3], [[list, 4], 5] compact!. # [1,2,3,4,5]
  ðŸŸ¥ FT-21 - Add a custom mark and sweep garbage collector.

  ðŸŸ© QOL-01 - Add a register based vm with a proper PoC.
  ðŸŸ© QOL-02 - Rename `Hash` to `Table`.
  ðŸŸ¥ QOL-03 - Make bang (!) messages denote persistant changes in object state.
  ðŸŸ¥ QOL-04 - Disallow all dynamic code generation.
              All code should be lexically defined.
              Extension happens only through the primitive bind message.
              Primitive bind only accepts method objects.
              Creating method objects are restricted to the literal definition.
              Method.new is NOT exposed to the front end directly, only indirectly through literal.
              The LSP should recusively track all messages and warn about the ones that raise.
              Raising errors should theoretically define all boundaries in whether an object can receive some message or not.
              When we send a message the LSP analyzes all paths and figures out which conditions would trigger a #dnu with a raise.
              If we lexically understand all state (which requires non-dynamically evaluated code) all potential #dnus should be caught.
                $Margaret -- #raise: message_name => _PRIM_RAISE_a1: @self a2: message_name,
                $Margaret -- #dnu: message_name => _PRIM_DNU_RAISE_a1: @self a2: message_name,
                $Numeric -- #/ 0 => raise: "division by zero",
                $Numeric -- #/ other => _PRIM_DIV_a1: @self a2: other,
              Here the LSP catches all `raise_from_dnu` messages.
              Normal raises are only caught when the multimethod can be lexically resovled.
                v1 = 0,
                v2 = $Margaret some_service,
                42 / 0,  comment: "static            -> always caught by the multimethod",
                42 / v1, comment: "deterministic     -> caught if we perform constant folding",
                42 / v2, comment: "non-deterministic -> cannot be caught",

  ðŸŸ© Create an `import/require` Margaret message.
     Probably simple concatenation of files (C-like include), not actual module system.
  ðŸŸ© Methods return tensors of bytecodes.
  ðŸŸ© Implement if:then:else: using lambda calculus.
  ðŸŸ© Add symbol objects and frozen strings.
  ðŸŸ© Setup 6 types of message binding and sending:
     subscript, lhs, unary, binary, keyword, assignment
  ðŸŸ© Compile time bytecodes
     Stored along with runtime ones.
     Executed only once.
     End-to-end optimization.
  ðŸŸ© Methods and functions compile to procs with own context.
     Procs compile to bitstrings/tensors/arrays of opcodes and are first class literals.
  ðŸŸ© Objects are (maybe?) represented as table of slots.
     Preferably only one parent.
  ðŸŸ© Store labels in the variable tables but check for uniqueness and raise or ignore otherwise.
  ðŸŸ© Care when cloning that only variables are being copied not labels.
